        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p><strong><em>Shumai</em></strong> is a type of
        traditional Chinese dumpling. In Cantonese
        cuisine, it is usually served as a dim sum
        snack. In addition to accompanying the
        Chinese diaspora, a variation of shaomai
        also appears in Japan and various
        southeast Asian countries.</p>
